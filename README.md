## Added In This Branch: Puppy Remote Control Platform

> This section documents features added by the `codex/custom-control-platform` branch on top of the official RIG-Omni project. Content after “Official Project Documentation” is retained from the upstream project.

Puppy can connect to an independent control server while retaining the vendor voice and MCP cloud services. This branch adds device management, web control, workflows, offline reminders, remote speech, a new expression system, and interactive robot behaviors.

### 1. Deploy With Docker Compose

Install Docker and Docker Compose on the server, then run:

```bash
git clone --branch codex/custom-control-platform https://github.com/hotuns/rig_omni.git
cd rig_omni
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
```

Docker pulls `hedongshu/rig-control:latest`, which supports AMD64 and ARM64. The control console data is stored in a Docker volume. To update the service or view logs:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml logs -f
```

### 2. Determine The Remote Address

- Local: `http://localhost:8000`
- LAN: `http://SERVER_LAN_IP:8000`
- Internet: `http://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:8000`

For public access, open TCP port 8000 and set `RIG_PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` to the public origin. When using a domain with an HTTPS reverse proxy, set it to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN`; the Puppy WebSocket address becomes `wss://YOUR_DOMAIN/ws/device`.

### 3. Add The Puppy

1. Open the Devices page in the control console.
2. Add the Puppy's Wi-Fi MAC address as its device ID.
3. Save the generated device token. Do not publish it or commit it to Git.

### 4. Configure And Flash The Firmware

Connect the Puppy to a computer with ESP-IDF v5.5.2+, then run:

```bash
source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

scripts/configure-puppy-control.sh \
  --url ws://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:8000/ws/device \
  --token YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN \
  --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101
```

Linux serial ports are typically `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`. Use `wss://YOUR_DOMAIN/ws/device` when the server is behind HTTPS. The script builds with an isolated temporary configuration and does not overwrite the repository's existing `sdkconfig`.

The first installation requires a complete flash with the updated partition table. Workflows, reminders, and media can then be synchronized remotely. See [`server/README.md`](server/README.md) for server details.

## 📖 Overview

RIG-Omni is an open-source embedded firmware for ESP32-S3 powered intelligent robots. It drives multiple robot forms — from a 5-servo robot dog (Puppy) to a 2-wheel hovercraft (Hover) — all from a single unified codebase.

Powered by a modular "one common core, per-form specialization" architecture, RIG-Omni delivers voice AI interaction, EAF-based emotion animations, IMU sensor fusion, MCP remote control tools, and more — all running on a single ESP32-S3 chip with a 240×240 round LCD.

> Mission: Give every robot builder an intuitive, modular, and delightful firmware experience.

### Build

```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone git@github.com:Xgorobot/RIG-Omni.git
cd RIG-Omni

# Source ESP-IDF environment
source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

# Select board type and firmware region (interactive menu)
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py menuconfig
# → RIG-Omni → Board Type → Puppy / Hover / ARM
# → RIG-Omni → Firmware Region → Domestic (China) / Overseas

# Build & Flash
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

### Production Release

```bash
# Build a release package (firmware + assets + manifest)
python tools/gen_bin_package.py

## 🤖 Multi-Board Configuration

RIG-Omni uses Kconfig to select the target robot form at build time:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
# RIG-Omni Configuration → Board Type
```

| Board | Motors | Motion | Key Files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RIG-Puppy** | 5 servos | Dog gait, head tracking, actions | `boards/puppy/puppy_board.cc` |
| **RIG-Hover** | 1 servo + 2 FOC motors | Balance, wheel drive, differential | `boards/hover/hover_board.cc` |
| **RIG-ARM** | Multi-servo (AX-12A) | Robotic arm, calibration, teach mode | `boards/arm/arm_board.cc` |

Each board has its own:
- Motor control logic (`xgo.cc/h`, `xgo_action.cc/h`)
- EAF emotion assets (`emoji/`, `240_240/`)
- Wake word model (`wakenet/`)
- Debug tools (`hover_debug_server.cc/h` for Hover)

All hardware drivers (IMU, Bluetooth, buttons, camera, battery) live in `boards/common/` and are shared across all forms.

### Firmware Region (Domestic / Overseas)

RIG-Omni supports building both domestic (China) and overseas firmware from a single codebase. Select the region in menuconfig:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
# → RIG-Omni → Firmware Region → Domestic (China) / Overseas
```

| Configuration | Domestic (China) | Overseas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OTA URL | `xl-api.xgorobot.com` | `xl-api.luwudynamics.ai` |
| Default Language | zh_CN | en_US |
| Wake Word | Custom (e.g. 小陆同学) | Custom + Hey Kira |
| WiFi Config Animation | Domestic QR code | Overseas QR code |

The region selection automatically configures:
- **OTA URL** — different server endpoints for firmware updates and server address discovery
- **Default Language** — `zh_CN` for domestic, `en_US` for overseas (users can still switch via MCP)
- **Wake Word** — overseas auto-enables ESP-SR built-in "Hey Kira" alongside the custom wake word
- **WiFi Config EAF** — different `wificonfig.eaf` animation (with region-specific QR code) is selected at build time

The `wificonfig.eaf` file is auto-generated during build. Each board keeps two source files:
```
main/boards/<board>/emoji/
    wificonfig_domestic.eaf    # Domestic QR code
    wificonfig_overseas.eaf    # Overseas QR code
    wificonfig.eaf             # Auto-generated (gitignored)
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding a New Board

```bash
# 1. Create board directory
mkdir -p main/boards/myrobot/240_240
mkdir -p main/boards/myrobot/emoji

# 2. Add board.cc + xgo.cc with your motor logic
# 3. Register in Kconfig (main/Kconfig.projbuild)
# 4. Add to CMakeLists.txt build config
```

### MCP Tools

Extend robot capabilities via the MCP framework. Example tool definition:

```cpp
mcp_server.AddTool("self.robot.move",
    "Move forward/backward in cm",
    PropertyList({Property("distance", kPropertyTypeInteger, -20, 20)}),
    [this](const PropertyList& props) -> ReturnValue {
        int distance = props["distance"].value<int>();
        // Execute movement...
        return true;
    });
```

### Debug Monitor

```bash
idf.py monitor
# Press Ctrl+] to exit
```
