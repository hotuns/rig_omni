## 📖 Overview

RIG-Omni is an open-source embedded firmware for ESP32-S3 powered intelligent robots. It drives multiple robot forms — from a 5-servo robot dog (Puppy) to a 2-wheel hovercraft (Hover) — all from a single unified codebase.

Powered by a modular "one common core, per-form specialization" architecture, RIG-Omni delivers voice AI interaction, EAF-based emotion animations, IMU sensor fusion, MCP remote control tools, and more — all running on a single ESP32-S3 chip with a 240×240 round LCD.

> Mission: Give every robot builder an intuitive, modular, and delightful firmware experience.

## 🤖 Multi-Board Configuration

RIG-Omni uses Kconfig to select the target robot form at build time:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
# RIG-Omni Configuration → Board Type
```

| Board | Motors | Motion | Key Files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RIG-Puppy** | 5 servos | Dog gait, head tracking, actions | `boards/puppy/puppy_board.cc` |
| **RIG-Hover** | 1 servo + 2 FOC motors | Balance, wheel drive, differential | `boards/hover/hover_board.cc` |
| **RIG-ARM** | Multi-servo (AX-12A) | Robotic arm, calibration, teach mode | `boards/arm/arm_board.cc` |

Each board has its own:
- Motor control logic (`xgo.cc/h`, `xgo_action.cc/h`)
- EAF emotion assets (`emoji/`, `240_240/`)
- Wake word model (`wakenet/`)
- Debug tools (`hover_debug_server.cc/h` for Hover)

All hardware drivers (IMU, Bluetooth, buttons, camera, battery) live in `boards/common/` and are shared across all forms.

### Firmware Region (Domestic / Overseas)

RIG-Omni supports building both domestic (China) and overseas firmware from a single codebase. Select the region in menuconfig:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
# → RIG-Omni → Firmware Region → Domestic (China) / Overseas
```

| Configuration | Domestic (China) | Overseas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OTA URL | `xl-api.xgorobot.com` | `xl-api.luwudynamics.ai` |
| Default Language | zh_CN | en_US |
| Wake Word | Custom (e.g. 小陆同学) | Custom + Hey Kira |
| WiFi Config Animation | Domestic QR code | Overseas QR code |

The region selection automatically configures:
- **OTA URL** — different server endpoints for firmware updates and server address discovery
- **Default Language** — `zh_CN` for domestic, `en_US` for overseas (users can still switch via MCP)
- **Wake Word** — overseas auto-enables ESP-SR built-in "Hey Kira" alongside the custom wake word
- **WiFi Config EAF** — different `wificonfig.eaf` animation (with region-specific QR code) is selected at build time

The `wificonfig.eaf` file is auto-generated during build. Each board keeps two source files:
```
main/boards/<board>/emoji/
    wificonfig_domestic.eaf    # Domestic QR code
    wificonfig_overseas.eaf    # Overseas QR code
    wificonfig.eaf             # Auto-generated (gitignored)
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Custom Control Server

Puppy can connect to the independent control server while retaining the vendor voice and MCP cloud services.

Install Docker and Docker Compose on the server, then run:

```bash
git clone --branch codex/custom-control-platform https://github.com/hotuns/rig_omni.git
cd rig_omni
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
```

Docker pulls `hedongshu/rig-control:latest`, which supports AMD64 and ARM64. Open `http://localhost:8000` locally or `http://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:8000` remotely. For public access, open TCP port 8000 and set `RIG_PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` to the public origin.

In the Devices page, add the Puppy's Wi-Fi MAC address as its device ID and save the generated device token. Connect the Puppy to a computer with ESP-IDF v5.5.2+, then run:

```bash
source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

scripts/configure-puppy-control.sh \
  --url ws://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:8000/ws/device \
  --token YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN \
  --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101
```

Use `wss://YOUR_DOMAIN/ws/device` when the server is behind HTTPS. Linux serial ports are typically `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`. The script builds with an isolated temporary configuration and does not overwrite the repository's existing `sdkconfig`.

### Adding a New Board

```bash
# 1. Create board directory
mkdir -p main/boards/myrobot/240_240
mkdir -p main/boards/myrobot/emoji

# 2. Add board.cc + xgo.cc with your motor logic
# 3. Register in Kconfig (main/Kconfig.projbuild)
# 4. Add to CMakeLists.txt build config
```

### MCP Tools

Extend robot capabilities via the MCP framework. Example tool definition:

```cpp
mcp_server.AddTool("self.robot.move",
    "Move forward/backward in cm",
    PropertyList({Property("distance", kPropertyTypeInteger, -20, 20)}),
    [this](const PropertyList& props) -> ReturnValue {
        int distance = props["distance"].value<int>();
        // Execute movement...
        return true;
    });
```

### Debug Monitor

```bash
idf.py monitor
# Press Ctrl+] to exit
```
